How the Web Works:

All computers connected to the web have certain functions. 
There are servers which hold all of the information for different websites, and then client 
computers that most of us use during our day to day activities to browse the internet.
Client computers use wi-fi, hotspots, and routers to connect to the internet and servers.
Clients start out by sending a requests to the servers for information so that they need when
someone wants to visit a website. The server then accepts the requests and begins searching
through everything to find and compile a response for the user. The server finishes processing 
and then sends the response back to the client so that the website can be viewed on the client 
computer.

There are several steps involved in accessing a website on browser. First,there is a DNS that allows websites 
to be connected to nicknames instead of presenting the web addressas a series of numbers. 
The DNS has the website's real address, and then can return the website back in a way that we would 
recognize; such as an HTTP address.  Then the browser sends an HTTP request, which asks the server to return
the website to the client computer so that the user can view it. Once the server has finished the request, it then
sends back all of the information in a lot of little chunks or packets that are then reassembled in the same
order to make the webpage visible the way that you want to see it!
